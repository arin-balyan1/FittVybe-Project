## Trainer Slot Time Picker
The image above showcases the time picker dialog used in the Add New Slot screen of the application. This feature allows the trainer to select a specific time for their availability on a given day. The interface supports:

Day selection (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.)

Time selection using a clock-style UI with AM/PM toggle

Easy-to-use circular dial to set both hours and minutes

A confirmation option (OK) to finalize the selected time

This implementation enables trainers to define and manage their available time slots, which can then be viewed by other users for scheduling or booking purposes.
